# Sets permissions of the GITHUB_TOKEN to allow deployment to GitHub Pages
permissions:
  contents: read

# Allow only one concurrent deployment, skipping runs queued between the run in-progress and latest queued.
# However, do NOT cancel in-progress runs as we want to allow these production deployments to complete.

    # Since `workflow_run` only has 3 activity types (`completed`, `requested` and `in_progress`),
    # even if `Quality` workflow gets completed by failing, this workflow starts to run.
    # To prevent this, we add a condition here.
